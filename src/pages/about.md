# About Pandy Goma

Welcome to my **about page**! This is an example of a Markdown page in Astro.

## What is this?

This page demonstrates how to create static content pages using Markdown (`.md` files) in your Astro project.

## Features of Markdown Pages

- ✅ **Easy to write** - Just use plain Markdown syntax
- ✅ **Automatic routing** - Files in `src/pages/` become routes
- ✅ **Layout support** - Use the `layout` frontmatter to apply your design
- ✅ **Metadata** - Define title, description, and other props in frontmatter

## How it Works

When you create `src/pages/about.md`, Astro automatically generates the route `/about` that you can visit in your browser.

### Example Code Block

```javascript
const greeting = "Hello from Markdown!";
console.log(greeting);
```

## Lists and More

You can use all standard Markdown features:

1. Ordered lists
2. Unordered lists
3. Links to [other pages](/)
4. **Bold** and *italic* text
5. Images and more!
